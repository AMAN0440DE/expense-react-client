 * CDN content delivery network - collection of servers delivers the web contevnt and whichever server is nearest to client will be delivered and by this way 
 * it will be faster, CDN lives in different parts of the world when one loads the jS files it also downloads CDN files
 * 
 * integrate bootstrap using CDN
 * 
 * and components in bootstrap are in html and react uses jsx so need to converted to jsx from converter
 * // use the link to cdn in index.html
